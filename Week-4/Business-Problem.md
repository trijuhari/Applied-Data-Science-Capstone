# Business Problem

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With a recorded population of 2,731,571 in 2016, it is the most populous city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America.
Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by many separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years. Former municipalities include East York, Etobicoke, Forest Hill, Mimico, North York, Parkdalse, Scarborough, Swansea, Weston and York. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods voering a few square kilometers.

### 1.2 Problem

I am currently living in a small neighborhood in the borough of West Toronto, called Dufferin, Dovercourt Village. I love where I live because of all the amenities it has to offer me, such as restaurants, gyms, parks and so on.
I work as an operations manager in a successful company located in the same neighborhood that I am living in. The problem comes when they offer me a “dream” promotion which the job location of it is not the same as the actual. The job neighborhood is in Scarborough, and it’s called Cedarbrae. 
This neighborhood is approximately 19.58km from Dufferin, my actual neighborhood. What it means is that I should move if I want to take this job opportunity. Therefore I want to make a data driven decision and find the optimal neighborhood between two parameters: nearness with the job location and similarity in relation to my actual neighborhood.

### 1.3 Interest

The personal interest of getting a promotion where I work and also can move to a neighborhood which is near the job location and is similar to my actual neighborhood, which I love.
